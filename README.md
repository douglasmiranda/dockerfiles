## dockerfiles

I try to put everything in containers, so the Dockerfiles here are created to fulfill my needs. Sometimes it's just a thing I use a lot or some building / packaging process to generate a binary on specific dist.

Sometimes I provide a docker-compose.yml file.

**Instructions**

I try to put on top of every Dockerfile the instructions.

**Dockerhub**

I will push to Dockerhub soon.

**Architectures**

I like to play with ARM, therefore some Dockerfiles are ARM / ARM64 - AARCH64, some are multiarch.
